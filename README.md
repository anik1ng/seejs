## Features

### ⚡ Instant Inline Results
See the value of every expression right next to your code as you type. No need to console.log everything — results appear automatically after each statement.

### 📋 Console Output Panel
All your console.log, console.error, and console.warn calls are captured in a dedicated panel. Keep your output organized and separate from inline values.
